Images to be included in ILO July 2013 Report


Introduction / Rainfall Estimate Sections
=========================================


The following are some plots that were produced while replicating the results of the earlier ILO report.  If it makes sense, these could be added as a visualization recap of what was learned from prior work.

Filename: Github /Output/ARCearlyranks.png 
Purpose: Shows the ecdf rankings of site-level cumulative ARC2 rainfall for the early window, based on read-in contract parameters (includes the dekadal cap).  Each site has a single 1.0 value (window-year with the most rainfall of the 2001-2012 period) and a single 0.0 value (window-year with the least rainfall of the 2001-2012 period).  Locations with multiple cumulative rainfall values will obviously have ties (e.g., two years with 0mm rainfall), and hence multiple years with the same hue for that site.  In a glance, we see regional coherence which diminishes with distance.  For example, 2002 was the worst year on record for many of the sites in the northeastern section, but still a very good year for the sites south of Maychew.   

****
Filename: Github /Output/ARClateranks.png 
Purpose: Same as above, but years 2001-2012 for only the late window, as calculated based on site-level contract parameters (includes the dekadal cap).  The late window suggests stronger spatial coherence than under the early window, with sites both north and south of 13.5N registering comparable rankings.

Bounding Box Scaling Section

Correlation Threshold Section
=============================


****

Hypothesis: Increasing the correlation coefficient threshold, and therefore masking out a greater number of EVI pixels whose temporal patterns do not emulate ARC2's pattern, will increase the probability that a spatially averaged EVI time-series matches the ARC2 time-series in pinpointing the worst years.  
Findings: Early window XXXX
