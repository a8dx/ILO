Images to be included in ILO July 2013 Report


Introduction / Rainfall Estimate Sections
=========================================


The following are some plots that were produced while replicating the results of the earlier ILO report.  If it makes sense, these could be added as a visualization recap of what was learned from prior work.

Filename: Github /Output/ARCearlyranks.png 
Purpose: Shows the ecdf rankings of site-level cumulative ARC2 rainfall for the early window, based on read-in contract parameters (includes the dekadal cap).  Each site has a single 1.0 value (window-year with the most rainfall of the 2001-2012 period) and a single 0.0 value (window-year with the least rainfall of the 2001-2012 period).  Locations with multiple cumulative rainfall values will obviously have ties (e.g., two years with 0mm rainfall), and hence multiple years with the same hue for that site.  In a glance, we see regional coherence which diminishes with distance.  For example, 2002 was the worst year on record for many of the sites in the northeastern section, but still a very good year for the sites south of Maychew.

Filename: Github /Output/ARClateranks.png 
Purpose: Same as above, but years 2001-2012 for only the late window, as calculated based on site-level contract parameters (includes the dekadal cap).  The late window suggests stronger spatial coherence than under the early window, with sites both north and south of 13.5N registering comparable rankings.

Bounding Box Scaling Section
============================

**** 
Hypothesis: Whereas our standard analysis scales up all MODIS pixels into a ~ 10 x 10km (0.1 x 0.1 deg) bounding box to compare against ARC2, we can vary the scaling size to identify what effects this has on agreement levels.  On the one hand, a larger bounding area improves the error cancellation and therefore bias reduction, across a greater number of pixels.  On the other, expanding our bounding box increases the probability of including non-vegetation pixels into our analysis.  We posit that there exists an optimal level below and above which agreement levels drop.  

Results:  No change in agreement is observed in the vast majority of locations during the early window, indicating site-level agreement is robust to scaling size.  Of the few sites where bounding size has an effect, more tend in the direction of lower agreement levels than from the benchmark.  Sites are more responsive to bounding size in the late window with a nearly even mix of pixels increasing and decreasing agreement percentages.  The ratio of sites with lower agreement levels in the modified version is higher for the extremes - 3.75 km and 15 km - than the other cases which better approximate the standard size.      
   
* CAVEAT *   The benchmark model EVI data comes from regridding all of Ethiopia, not just an individual site.  Therefore regridding under the current approach regrids around the site as the center of the bounding box, whereas the benchmark model calls whichever pixel in the regridded space that site lies in.  This fundamental difference may be responsible for the discrepancy between the benchmark results and the 11.5 km results, despite the nearly synonymous bounding size.

Correlation Threshold Section
=============================


****

Hypothesis: Increasing the correlation coefficient threshold, and therefore masking out a greater number of EVI pixels whose temporal patterns do not emulate ARC2's pattern, will increase the probability that a spatially averaged EVI time-series matches the ARC2 time-series in pinpointing the worst years.
